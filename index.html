                    <p>Research groups face persistent challenges in capturing, storing, and retrieving knowledge that is distributed
                    across team members. Although structured data intended for
                    analysis and publication is often well managed, much of a
                    group's collective knowledge remains informal, fragmented, or
                    undocumented—often passed down orally through meetings,
                    mentoring, and day-to-day collaboration. This includes private
                    resources such as emails, meeting notes, training materials,
                    and ad hoc documentation. Together, these reflect the group's
                    tacit knowledge—the informal, experience-based expertise that
                    underlies much of their work. Accessing this knowledge can be
                    difficult, requiring significant time and insider understanding.
                    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems offer promising
                    solutions by enabling users to query and generate responses
                    grounded in relevant source material. However, most current
                    RAG-LLM systems are oriented toward public documents and
                    overlook the privacy concerns of internal research materials.
                    We introduce AquiLLM, a lightweight,
                    modular RAG system designed to meet the needs of research
                    groups. AquiLLM supports varied document types and configurable privacy settings, enabling more effective access to both
                    formal and informal knowledge within scholarly groups.</p>

                    <p><b>Data Types</b> - Research groups generate a range of data, from publications and pulibc datasets that are formally published to informal data products like presentations, meeting notes, plots, etc. The informal data is just as important for the daily function of groups, but are difficult to capture and used. AquiLLM seeks to integrate both formal and informal data products while respecting the different levels of privacy that maybe necessary with non-public data.</p>

                    <p><b>Architecture</b> - AquiLLM is composed of a Django backend with custom LLM, tool calling and RAG integration logic, a front end composed of Django templates, many of which contain React components, and external services: the database, object storage, and LLM inference API. AquiLLM’s focus on easy deployment and
maintenance for small teams drove a number of technical choices.</p>

                    <p>AquiLLM currently has a basic 1-5 rating system for responses, however responses and ratings aren't stored in the database and users don't have the ability to explain what went wrong.</p>
                    <p>AquiLLM developers are interested in being able to critically evaluate the performance of AquiLLM so that they can figure out how to improve it. In order to evaluate the responses however, the existing rating system needs to be completed and expanded upon to give developers more information to work with. This is step 1 in improving AquiLLM, and later steps in the coming months will include building a system to seamlessly integrate data from the astronomical instrument OSIRIS (OH-Suppressing Infrared Imaging Spectrograph), based in Hawaii.</p>
